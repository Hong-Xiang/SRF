### Important Note for CASToR: 
    ```
    The configuration folder of CASToR is hard coded and is linked to the /path/to/castor_source/config directory.
    However, when you install CASToR with spack, this source tree directory is temporary and will be removed after the installation.
    Thus, you have to specify a configuration directory.(This has been done by the spack package file and the directory is /home/you/castor/config). Then you need to copy the folders and files in the source tree configuration folder into this directory, or you will get error when you run the execution.
