The json files in this folder provide the template of configuration file for utilities. The json configure will be converted to dict via a parser and then generate the command for the utilities of CASToR. All of options are presented in the json, while some of them are unnecessary.
For these options, you can set 'null' to them. For much more details, please refer to the CASToR User's guide documents on <http://www.castor-project.org>
